Some documentation to refer to:

- Our main web socket (mWS) sends opcode 4 with a guild ID and channel ID.
- The mWS receives VOICE_STATE_UPDATE and VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE.
- We pull the session_id from VOICE_STATE_UPDATE.
- We pull the token, endpoint and server_id from VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE.
- Then we initiate the voice web socket (vWS) pointing to the endpoint.
- We send opcode 0 with the user_id, server_id, session_id and token using the vWS.
- The vWS sends back opcode 2 with an ssrc, port, modes(array) and hearbeat_interval.
- We send a UDP discovery packet to endpoint:port and receive our IP and our port in LE.
- Then we send our IP and port via vWS with opcode 1.
- When that's all done, we receive opcode 4 from the vWS.
- Finally we can transmit data to endpoint:port.
